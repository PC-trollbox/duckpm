# duckpm
A kinda bad way of doing package managing.


## Contribution
PRs are welcome.


## Server
Server is specified in `duckpm-global-config.json` file. If you don't have it, run `node main install --itself` or `duckpm install --itself`.

Then change `serverLocation` value, to a server, for example http://localhost:3000/quack/.

You'll need Express for the server to run. Do `npm install express` to install the required tool.
